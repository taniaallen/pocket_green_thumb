#Pocket Green Thumb


## Synopsis

Gardening has always been a hobby I wanted to take up when I became a homeowner. However there is so much information to know about cultivating plants and those details can be different with every plant you decide to grow. The pocket green thumb app will allow a user to easily locate the information needed for growing their beloved plants in their pocket. The pocket green thumb app will allow a user to instantly look up a plant to determine how much water and sunlight it will need, what the soil pH should be and more from their smartphone.

## To create the pocket green thumb app, the following will need to be considered (MVP):

- A landing page for the user to create a username and password and sign in.
- An index page that will display the searchbar user profile name and list of plants saved.
- Search bar that will search through the USDA plants API to locate information on the plant searched.
- The ability to click on a search result to see full details of plant.
- The ability to click on a search result and save it to a user's schema in a database.
- Display a list of saved plants on the index page (partial)
- The ability to edit the list
- The ability to delete an item off of the list and the database.
- 

### Stretch

- User can drop image of a plant to identify the plant via the JustVisual plants API.
